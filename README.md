## Dataset

We have constructed a new dataset for aspect based multimodal sentiment analysis, namely Multi-ZOL. [Download]( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1L3oAFJyawolDsAmf-dFMJw), extract code: gdmj 

```
/jsonData includes all reviews.
/multi_jsonData only includes the multimodal reviews.
/img includes all supporting images
```

## Code

```
/layers includes general neural network layers
/models includes all baseline methods we implement
```

Our implement is based on  [ABSA-PyTorch](https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch). Thanks them for their contribution!
